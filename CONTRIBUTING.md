#Contributing to open-project-linter
## Summary
`open-project-linter` is an automated checklist that will make sure that your
open source project has the documentation and structure it needs to be
successful, and that it doesn't contain any information it shouldn't.

## How to get involved
Currently, @fhocutt and @brainwane are writing a roadmap and figuring out
the project organization/direction. As work goes on, this will be updated.

## Status and plans
We will start small and add features as development goes on.

To start with: a minimum viable command-line application, which will check a
local repository of unversioned code for certain key files. This will be
extended to check for local git repositories and analyze the repository history
and structure, and from there to checking repositories located at a given
GitHub URL.
